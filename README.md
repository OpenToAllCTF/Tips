## IDA
* Common hotkeys:

  | Key              | Effect                          |
  |------------------|---------------------------------|
  | `Esc`            | Go back                         |
  | `Ctrl-Enter`     | Go forward                      |
  | `H`, `Q`, `B`    | View as decimal, hex, or binary |
  | `N`/`U`          | Name/Undefine symbol            |
  | `D`, `C`, `P`    | Convert to data, code, function |
  | `Ctrl-w`         | Save                            |
* Learn to create and use structs.
* IDAPython is very powerful and worth learning.
* Use FLIRT whenever you see a static binary. You can save a ton of normally wasted time reverse engineering common functions.
* Code coverage and tracing analysis is a useful technique to assist with reverse engineering. IDA has built in coverage and trace highlighting capabilities features. [Lighthouse](https://github.com/gaasedelen/lighthouse) is also a great plugin for coverage analysis.
* [Keypatch](http://www.keystone-engine.org/keypatch) is a useful plugin that offers extra features compared to the built-in assembler

## Debugging

### GDB

* Don't suffer through vanilla GDB. Use something like [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef), [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda), or [Voltron](https://github.com/snare/voltron).
* You can also combine [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) with [Pwngdb](https://github.com/scwuaptx/Pwngdb), which is a powerful add-on that supports advanced heap exploitation and FILE stream oriented exploitation features.
* Learn these!
  * `command <bp#>` - Run commands when a bp is hit.
  * `ignore <bp#> <count>` - Ignore the next _count_ occurrences of _bp_.
  * `watch|rwatch|awatch <addr> [thread <thread>] [mask <mask>]` - Break when specified address is written to, read from, or either.
  * `hbreak <addr>` - Set a hardware breakpoint.
  * `tbreak <addr>` - Set a temporary breakpoint that disappears once hit.
  * `advance <addr>` - Continue until the specified address.
  * `catch syscall [syscall]` - Break on syscall (all or the specified).
  * `catch signal [signal]` - Break on signal (all or the specified).
  * `bt` - View stack frames (backtrace).
  * `up`/`down` - Move up or down to a different stack frame.
  * `set follow-fork-mode <child|parent>` - Tell gdb to either trace the parent or 'move' to the child on `fork`.
  * `set follow-exec-mode <same|new>` - Tell gdb to either trace the original target or 'move' to the new process on `exec*`.

### Redressing a Stripped Libc
* Often times when we do pwnables, we are given the pwnable along with a stripped version of the libc that the pwnable is using on the remote server. If we want an easier time debugging with the provided libc preloaded, here are some steps we can take to add symbols back to the stripped libc. (dependencies: [eu-unstrip](https://helpmanual.io/help/eu-unstrip/)) 
  1. run `strings <stripped-libc> | grep glibc` to determine the libc version
  1. download the associated debug symbol file (eg.[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/amd64/libc6-dbg/2.23-0ubuntu5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/amd64/libc6-dbg/2.23-0ubuntu5))
  1. merge stripped libc file with debug symbol  file using `eu-unstrip` like so: `eu-unstrip <stripped-libc> <symbol-file>`
  1. now `<symbol-file>` will be your newly redressed libc w/symbols!

## Shell-fu
* `file` - Try to determine what type of file you have.
* `strace` - See which syscalls an executable executes.
* `ltrace` - See which library calls an executable executes.
* `ldd` - See which dynamic libraries an executable loads.
* `nm` - Dump a binary's symbols
* Learn to use pipes and [redirection](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/redirection_tutorial)! When you want to script input, this is very handy, and doing it incorrectly can lead to successful payloads being unusable (e.g. spawning a shell whose _stdin_ is not connected to your terminal).
* To pipe output to an application, but regain access to _stdin_ after, use a subshell:
```bash
(python3 -c "print('AAAApayload')"; cat -) | nc pwn.me.org 5555
```
*  `cd -` - Go back to your last working directory.
* `!!` - Repeats your last command. Can also be used as a parameter.

```bash
cd /root
bash: cd: /root: Permission denied
sudo !!
```

* Readline shortcuts are _super_ handy.

  | Key      | Effect                             |
  |----------|------------------------------------|
  | `Ctrl-E` | Go to end of line                  |
  | `Ctrl-A` | Go to start of line                |
  | `Ctrl-L` | Clear terminal                     |
  | `Ctrl-U` | Delete everything left of cursor   |
  | `Ctrl-K` | Delete everything right of cursor  |
  | `Ctrl-W` | Delete word left                   |
  | `Ctrl-Y` | Paste last deleted text            |
  | `Ctrl-F` | Move cursor forward one char       |
  | `Ctrl-B` | Move cursor back one char          |
  | `Ctrl-P` | Move back one line in history      |
  | `Ctrl-N` | Move forward one line in history   |
  | `Ctrl-R` | Search bash history (start typing) |
  | `Ctrl-G` | Cancel history search              |

## Jail Challenges

### Python Jails
[Gynvael Python Jail tips](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/n/python_sandbox_escape)

#### Useful functions
* eval() / exec() / compile(), execute any python code
* dir() / type()
* globals() / locals() / vars(), finding useful variables
* getattr() / setattr(), useful when you need to call object.banned(). You can do getattr(object, "ban"+"ned") or something along the lines

#### Interesting Behaviour
* "A""B" == "AB", useful when `+` is blocked

### Bash Jails

#### Reading files
* Sometimes `cat` is filtered or banned, these are some alternatives
* fold
* nl (numbered)
* head (head portion of file)
* tail (tail portion of file)

## _hooks
In libc, there are `*_hook` function pointers that are called that are writeable:

```bash
$ less ./db/local-acd0f91e833f06b2a822be84579f70edf4e80050.symbols | grep _hook
__free_hook 001b18b0
argp_program_version_hook 001b3794
_dl_open_hook 001b35d4
__malloc_hook 001b0768
__realloc_hook 001b0764
__malloc_initialize_hook 001b18b4
__after_morecore_hook 001b18ac
__memalign_hook 001b0760
```
By default, these pointers are NULL. These function pointers are only called IF they are not NULL:

```C
void
__libc_free(void* mem)
{
  mstate ar_ptr;
  mchunkptr p;                          /* chunk corresponding to mem */

  void (*hook) (void *, const void *)
    = force_reg (__free_hook);
  if (__builtin_expect (hook != NULL, 0)) {
    (*hook)(mem, RETURN_ADDRESS (0));
    return;
  }
```

If you can overwrite one of these pointers, you can control RIP the next time the associated libc function is called!
Useful if FULL RELRO is enabled/the GOT is read-only and we have a write-what-where!

### Protips
* `printf()` actually calls `malloc()` if printing anything out with a width > 65535-32!
* any memory corruption error you trigger will call `alloca()`/`__malloc_hook`

## Null Termination
#### Do NOT read past first null byte
* strcpy()
* strncpy()

#### Do read past first null byte
* read()
* gets()
* fgets()
* memcpy()
* scanf()

#### Does copy the terminating nullbyte from src to dst
* strcpy()
